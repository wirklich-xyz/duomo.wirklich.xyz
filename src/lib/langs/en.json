There are different options, the typical trip includes the \"terraces\", which basically means you enter the building on the north-side and directly access the rooftop of the building. You will enter the interior of the building going down from the roof. Consider at least 30-45min for the terraces. <br /> <a class=\"button\" href=\"https://ticket.duomomilano.it/en/biglietti/\" target=\"_blank\">Go to official booking site (link)</a><br /> Better double-check weather and cloud predictions: <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/de/it/milan/214046/daily-weather-forecast/214046\" target=\"_blank\">AccuWeather</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bergfex.it/sommer/mailand/wetter/\" target=\"_blank\">bergfex.it</a>"
